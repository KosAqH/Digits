### Digits classification

This repository is my attempt to perform efficient classification of digits from MNIST dataset.

Dataset is available here: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/digit-recognizer/data

Repo consist of:
 - simple analysis of dataset
 - attempts to solve problem with ML algorithms: SVC and KNN
 - attempts to process data in order to get higher accuracy score
 - attempts to solve problem with CNN created with PyTorch
 - simple web application created in Flask that let's you test some of those models

Needed python packages can be found in requirements.txt file in this repo. 

Some sources I used when playing with that project:
